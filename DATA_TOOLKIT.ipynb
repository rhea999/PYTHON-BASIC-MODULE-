        "\n",
        "NumPy's array slicing is significantly faster than Python's list slicing due to the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Contiguous Memory Layout\n",
        "* NumPy arrays store data in contiguous blocks of memory, just like C arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python lists store pointers to objects, which are scattered in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes NumPy operations much faster because memory access is efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Fixed Data Types\n",
        "* All elements in a NumPy array are of the same data type (homogeneous).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python lists are heterogeneous (can contain any type).\n",

        "* Slicing a NumPy array returns a view (reference) to the original data.\n",

        "      a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
